There are several apps available for selecting restaurants based on cuisine or location.

Hardly any tools available that would help you select what you want to eat without going through entire menu.

This project is about building a tool that would save time and effort of reading the entire menu just to select what you want to eat.

A tool that would quickly answer queries such as What is the price of the dish?  Or What is the cheapest item on the menu?

It tries to achieve this by extracting dish names and prices from the menu, mapping those together in the form of a map and answering the queries related to the menu

The user-facing tool built as part of this project is aimed to quickly find out answers to common menu related questions

This tool will be written as a mobile app, for smartphones that can take pictures, and have internet connection to communicate with the backend service

The purpose of this project is to:
  Create A map of DISH and PRICE from the extracted text of the menu image
  
  Use the map to answer common queries related to the menu to help you select food easily
